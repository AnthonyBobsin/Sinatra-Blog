Sinatra-Blog

A simple blog website made with Sinatra and Foundation. This blog uses SQLite3 for development, PostgreSQL for production and Active Record.

It was made for a brief introduction to Ruby back-end frameworks before tackling Ruby on Rails.
Only thing that is missing is a log-in system to control who can create/edit/delete posts.

Feel free to create, edit or delete your own posts, but please refrain from altering the existing posts as they are there to add depth. Also please keep it appropriate when creating your own posts. Thanks for your cooperation, enjoy!
