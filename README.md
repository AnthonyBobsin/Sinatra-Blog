Sinatra-Blog

A simple blog website made with Sinatra and Foundation. This blog uses SQLite3 and Active Record.

It was made for a brief introduction to Ruby back-end frameworks before tackling Ruby on Rails.
Only thing that is missing is a log-in system to control who can create/edit/delete posts.
